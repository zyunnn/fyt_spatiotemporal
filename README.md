## spatiotemporal-fuel-consumption-forecasting-2020
Final year thesis at HKUST. We propose a novel temporal graph neural network framework for spatiotemporal forecasting, specifically on two real-world datasets:
- Shenzhen Fuel Consumption (SZ-FC) dataset
- Performance Measurement System (PeMS-M) dataset
